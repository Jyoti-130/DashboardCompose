## Project Description
DashboardCompose is a Jetpack Compose–based Android application that demonstrates a modern dashboard design.  
It features a **Doctor Detail Card** with appointment information and action buttons.  
Users can interact with the UI — for example, tapping the **Call icon** will open the phone dialer to quickly call the doctor.  
The UI is built entirely with **Jetpack Compose components**, following Material 3 design principles.
